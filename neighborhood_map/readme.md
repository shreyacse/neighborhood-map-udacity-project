## Neighborhood Map Project

##Description
It displays a map with my favorite locations in the neighborhood I live in.
There is a button named menu that toggles the navigation sidebar.
If you click in a location on the side bar or in one of the markers in the map,
it will query wikipedia's API for articles related to the location name and display links in an infoWindow.
You can also filter the locations by typing into the input box located at the top of the navigation sidebar.
